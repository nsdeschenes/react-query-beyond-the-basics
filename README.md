# React Query - Beyond the Basics
A workshop by TkDodo

In this workshop, we'll go beyond the fundamentals and explore some of the more powerful features React Query has to offer. You'll gain a deeper understanding of how it works under the hood and learn how to write scalable, maintainable React Query code.

Together, we'll build a simple example app and incrementally enhance it with one core objective in mind: delivering the best possible user experience. That means snappy interactions, minimal layout shifts, and avoiding unnecessary loading spinners wherever we can.

To achieve this, we'll dive into advanced techniques like various forms of prefetching (including integration with route loaders), seeding the query cache, crafting smooth paginated experiences, and even persisting query state through full page reloads using persistence plugins.

Note: You should have prior knowledge about React Query if you attend this workshop.
